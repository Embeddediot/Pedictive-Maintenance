STMicroelectronics is happy to receive contributions from the community, based on an initial Contributor License Agreement (CLA) procedure.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you are an individual writing original source code and you are sure {\bfseries{you own the intellectual property}}, then you need to sign an Individual CLA (\href{https://cla.st.com}{\texttt{ https\+://cla.\+st.\+com}}).
\item If you work for a company that wants also to allow you to contribute with your work, your company needs to provide a Corporate CLA (\href{https://cla.st.com}{\texttt{ https\+://cla.\+st.\+com}}) mentioning your Git\+Hub account name.
\item If you are not sure that a CLA (Individual or Corporate) has been signed for your Git\+Hub account, you can check here (\href{https://cla.st.com}{\texttt{ https\+://cla.\+st.\+com}}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please note that\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Corporate CLA will always take precedence over the Individual CLA.
\item One CLA submission is sufficient for any project proposed by STMicroelectronics.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We recommend to engage first a communication through an issue, in order to present your proposal and just to confirm that it corresponds to a STMicroelectronics domain or scope.
\item Then fork the project to your Git\+Hub account to further develop your contribution. Please use the latest commit version.
\item Please submit one Pull Request for one new feature or proposal. This will facilitate the analysis and the final merge if accepted.
