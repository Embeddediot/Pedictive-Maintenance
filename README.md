# Pedictive-Maintenance
This project will be a part of a 10 ETCS point special course with Martin Nordal Petersen as supervisor. The goal of the project is to utilize existing knowledge in embedded programming, Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning to make a system which can predict maintenance on a simulated motor setup.

## Overview
This project implements a predictive maintenance system using an STM32 microcontroller and STM32CubeIDE. The system monitors various sensors to predict and prevent potential failures. The project is coded on a STM32H755ZI-Q, II3DWB SPI accelerometer, a STTS22HTR I2C temperature (code in full chain). There is also a PWM controller consisting of an ESP8266 an encoder and an OLED display (code is in FAN_CONTROL). The main system monitors the pwm fan with an accelerometer collecting data for the X-Cube-AI model, giving an output of which state the fan is in. The model used is a keras model trained on this specific fan in 5 states, idle, 50 % speed, 100 % speed, fail and blocked.
