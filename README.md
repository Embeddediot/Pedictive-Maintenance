# Pedictive-Maintenance
This project will be a part of a 10 ETCS point special course with Martin Nordal Petersen as supervisor. The goal of the project is to utilize existing knowledge in embedded programming, Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning to make a system which can predict maintenance on a simulated motor setup.
